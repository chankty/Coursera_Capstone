In this project, I hope to create a traveller map of Singapore that would show the key hotels around Raffel's place and the restuarants nearby. \n\nIdeally, it should include the following details for travellers:\n- the specific cuisine it serves\n- self-service or table service (casual or fine dining)\n- restaurat atmosphere and dress code\n- budget and average spending\n- reviews and ratings"
